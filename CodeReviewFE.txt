Overall: the styles can be defined in a separate style block to improve readability and maintainability.
Line 8: this function displays the fuel consumed by the car.
    Typo in component name "CarsFuuel", should be "CarsFuel"
Line 9: the style object can be extracted into a separate constant or imported from a CSS file to improve readability
    and maintainability.
Line 12: this function displays an alert message when the fuel consumption is greater than 1200.
Line 14: "useState" is used to manage state within a functional component.
Line 16: "useEffect" hook is used to update the state of the component when the "fuel" prop changes.
    The logic in the "useEffect" hook can be simplified to a single line using the ternary operator, like this:
    "setState(fuel > 1200 ? 1 : 0)".
Line 40: The updateCoordinates() method is called when the component is mounted, which increments the value of "x" and
    updates the value of "f" based on the new value of "x".
Line 41: "setInterval" is called when the component is mounted, which will increment the value of "x" every 1000ms. Based
    on the new value of "x", the value of "f" will be updated.
Line 50: the render method displays the position and fuel consumption of the car using the CarsFuel() and Alert() components.
Line 51, 52: "var" can be replaced with "const", it would help to prevent accidental reassignments, and allows for
    better optimization by the JavaScript engine. "const" should be used for variables that are not reassigned, and
    "x1" and "fuel" are not reassigned.
