Overall: all functions could use return type declaration for easier code reading and debugging.
    For some places the naming could be full, so it is easier to understand,
    for example "GridlinkVqLongForm" or 'gridlink_vq_short, what is Vq? What is "tg_phi" in line 173.
    Functions that aren't being used in this class, but in child classes, should be at the bottom of the class
    for easier code reading.
    Don't use different naming conventions in the same code, stick to one, for example class names "gridlink_alerts" and "AlertsTool"
    Instead of using "Prepare..." for function naming, you can use "Set..." as it better indicates what the function does.
    Extract reusable code into functions and use them in other places, for example for function AlertFormConfig()
    in line 252.
Line 21: if the AlertsTool class constructor already initializes all the required properties and performs necessary
    setup tasks, then the __construct() method in gridlink_alerts class may not be needed.
    If the __construct() method is not needed, then it should be removed.
Line 25: a method that calls the parent class's Prepare() method
Line 30: the GetSubtoolName() method and SUBTOOL_NAME constant are not needed, because the GetSubtoolName() method
    isn't being used anywhere and SUBTOOL_NAME constant is only used in the GetSubtoolName() method.
Line 35: this method returns the path to the template directory
Line 41: this method fetches all the alerts of various types and assigns them to the template and sets it as the output
    for the "HtmlPage". It also assigns the URLs for the various actions that can be performed on the alerts.
Line 44: is missing a bracket ")" at the end of the line for "->assign()"
Line 55: this method saves the alert settings based on the alert type, checks if the alert already exists or not by the
    alert ID. Gets the necessary information about the object and if the save is successful, it redirects to ActionAlertForm().
Line 41, 55: if functions ActionAlertList() and ActionSaveAlert() are also in the parent class then they are implemented
    correctly, but if they are not in the parent class then they should be removed from "gridlink_alerts" class, because
    the IDE has noted that the functions are potentially not being used here.
Line 60: code checks if $alert is truthy before creating a new $alert, but then assigns $alert_type to $alert->GetType()
    even if $alert is falsy. This may result in an error.
Line 105: if statement should have an else statement to handle the case when the if statement is false, so either way
    the $save_status variable is set to a value.
Line 112: this method displays a form for editing an existing alert or creating a new one. If an alert ID is
    provided, the method retrieves the alert object and populates the form with the alert's current settings. If there
    are any errors, they are displayed on the form. It prepares the range alert configuration if the alert type is
    "gridlink_cons_range". If the alert type is "gridlink_cons_range", it converts the range from watt-seconds to kilowatt-hours.
    $alert_id is unnecessary, because its value is overwritten immediately.
    The function is doing a lot of things at once, so it would be better to split it into smaller functions.
    Also, the code uses a mix of procedural and object-oriented programming styles, which makes it harder to read. Try
    using only one style.
Line 171: this method takes an array of configuration parameters as an argument and sets default values for two of those
    parameters ("tg_phi" and "intervals_per_period") if they are not already set.
Line 179: this method takes an array of configuration parameters as an argument and, depending on whether the
    array is empty, sets default values for some of the parameters or converts certain parameters from strings to arrays
    if they are not already arrays.
Line 183: "foreach" loop iterates over the array attributes using $id as the key variable, but $id is never used.
    This could be confusing to someone reading the code, and might indicate that there's a logic error.
Line 203: single "&" is being used not "&&" for the if statement. This could cause unexpected behavior.
Line 211: this method sets a default value for "max_temp" if it is not already set.
Line 217: this method returns an associative array with alert class names as keys and arrays of supported device types as values.
    if function GetConnpointTypesByAlert() is also in the parent class then it is implemented correctly,
    but if it is not in the parent class then it should be removed from "gridlink_alerts" class, because
    the IDE has noted that the function is potentially not being used here.
Line 230: this method takes an alert type as an argument and returns an array of connection point IDs that are available
    for that type of alert.
Line 237: has an unnecessary "$" in front of brackets
Line 252: this method returns an associative array with alert form information, including paths to templates, names,
    alert types, and IDs. The array also includes a JSON-encoded string of filtered devices for each form, which is
    generated by calling the GetAvailableConnpoints method for the appropriate alert type.
    Extract repeated code. Consider creating a function that takes in the unique information and returns the
    common configuration options for each form.
    GetTypeFromClass() could be replaced with the "::class" constant
